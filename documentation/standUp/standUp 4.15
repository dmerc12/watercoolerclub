Discussion and Work:

1) Our class assignment for today is to:
    * First assure we have finished our Portfolio
    * Secondly work on projects
2) In terms of project work, most of us are working on the DAO. As we have not yet been taught how to mock and stub
in Java, we will mostly work on DAO until beginning of next week.

- Zach: Individual and Company Skill Tests
- Lesley: Individual and Company Log In/Out + Account Creation
- Jeryl: Individual Search for Jobs, Apply for Jobs, and View Job Applications
- Dylan: Company Post Jobs, View Posted Jobs, View Applicants, and Delete Job Postings
