Discussion and Work:

1) As a group, we are mostly working on or finishing up the back-end, at various stages; Zach is on the front-end

2) Status:
    - Zach is working on the end-to-end testing today, setting up test pages
    - Leslie finished up the API and is working on the html landing pages; helped Grace with changing the phone number
        from a long data type to a string
    - Dylan finished the API, and is working on the html pages also, (see discussion below on dynamically changing
        elements on the webpages with Zach's template
    - Grace is finishing up the Service Layer
    - Jeryl is finishing up the Service Layer

3) Discussion on logging and dynamically changing webpages:
    A) Logging:
        All agreed to follow Zach's logging convention at the beginning/end of every method, and at an error message:
            "BEGIN/FINISH [layer] function [function name] with data:\n" + (incoming paramaters)
            "ERROR with [layer] function [function name] with error: " + error message as string
    B) Dynamically changing webpages:
        Zach explained to us how he uses his template to dynamically change the elements in a webpage--Dylan and I
        will both need to use this for our "View Jobs", "View Applied Jobs", and "Delete Jobs" webpages.
