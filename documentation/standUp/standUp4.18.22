Discussion and Work:

1) As a group, we are mostly finishing up the DAO, and beginning the Service Layer
2) Blockers:
    - Zach assisted Dylan with his blocker; he is having an issue throwing an error for an empty list; still unresolved
    - Zach assisted Jeryl with re-downloading Java/JDK as the test files were not be read in Java by IntelliJ; we also
        reviewed the tests in DAO
    - Zach assisted Grace with the coding and syntax in her portion on the DAO
