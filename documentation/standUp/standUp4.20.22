Stand Up Wednesday April 20

Scrum Leader:   Zachary Wilmer
Scrumlings:     Grace George
                Dylan Mercer
                Leslie Rich
                Jeryl Skinner


Discussion and Work:

1) As a group, we are mostly working on or finishing up the back-end, at various stages; Zach is starting the front end
2) Status:
    - Zach is starting up the front-end--is finished with the DAO, Service Layer, API--creating, viewing Skills Tests
    - Lelie is finishing up the back end, is working on the API, and then will start the front end
    - Dylan is testing in the API, and then will move on to the front end
    - Grace is working on the Service Layer
    - Jeryl is still finishing up the DAO with the View test for the Applied Jobs feature
3) Main blocker that is still outstanding is Dylan's negative test for the View feature on the company side,
    with the empty list returning null instead of the Exception--Eric will get back to him for the solution
